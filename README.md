# Movie Budget and Revenue Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the **economics of Hollywood** by analyzing the *Movie Budgets & Box Office Performance* dataset. The main goal is to investigate whether **higher film budgets lead to higher revenue** at the box office, helping studios make informed decisions about investment in film production.

## Objectives
- Analyze trends in movie budgets and box office revenue.
- Examine the relationship between production spending and financial success.
- Identify patterns in genres, release years, and revenue performance.
- Visualize insights to support data-driven decisions for film investments.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handling missing data, inconsistent formats, and duplicates.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Summarizing budgets, revenue, and profitability.
- **Visualizations:**
  - **Scatterplots:** To examine correlations between budget and revenue.
  - **Bar Charts:** To compare revenue across genres and years.
  - **Box Plots:** To highlight distributions of budgets and revenue.
  - **Linear Regression:** Using **Seaborn's `regplot`** to model and visualize the relationship between budget and box office revenue.
